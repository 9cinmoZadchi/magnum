In this article, we will show you how to use EPLAN Electric P8 2.2 for efficient electrical engineering, by following these steps:
 
1. Create a new project and select the appropriate settings.
2. Draw the schematic diagrams using the symbols, macros and functions provided by the software.
3. Assign device tags, wire numbers and cross-references automatically or manually.
4. Generate reports, such as bill of materials, terminal diagrams, cable lists and PLC overviews.
5. Export the project data to other formats, such as PDF, DWG or XML.

## Step 1: Create a new project and select the appropriate settings
 
To create a new project in EPLAN Electric P8 2.2, go to File > New > Project. You will see a dialog box where you can enter the project name, description, language and other details. You can also select the project type, such as single-line or multi-line, and the standard that you want to follow, such as IEC or ANSI. You can also choose the page format, grid size and scale for your drawings.
 
After you create a new project, you can adjust the project settings by going to Project > Properties. Here you can configure various options, such as numbering schemes, display modes, plot frames and fonts. You can also define the project structure by adding folders and pages to organise your drawings.
 
## Step 2: Draw the schematic diagrams using the symbols, macros and functions provided by the software
 
To draw the schematic diagrams in EPLAN Electric P8 2.2, you can use the symbols library that contains thousands of predefined symbols for various components, such as switches, relays, motors and sensors. You can access the symbols library by going to Insert > Symbol or by clicking on the symbol icon on the toolbar. You can also search for symbols by name or category using the filter function.
 
You can also use macros to insert predefined groups of symbols that represent common circuits or functions, such as start-stop circuits or motor starters. You can access the macros library by going to Insert > Macro or by clicking on the macro icon on the toolbar. You can also create your own macros by selecting a group of symbols and saving them as a macro file.

Another way to draw schematic diagrams in EPLAN Electric P8 2.2 is to use functions that automate certain tasks or calculations, such as generating contacts from coils, assigning potentials to terminals or creating PLC inputs and outputs. You can access the functions by going to Utilities > Functions or by clicking on the function icon on the toolbar. You can also create your own functions using scripts or formulas.
 
## Step 3: Assign device tags, wire numbers and cross-references automatically or manually
 
To identify and document your devices and wires in EPLAN Electric P8 2.2, you can assign device tags and wire numbers automatically or manually. Device tags are alphanumeric codes that uniquely identify each device in your project. Wire numbers are numeric codes that indicate the connection between devices or terminals. You can assign device tags and wire numbers by going to Edit > Numbering or by clicking on the numbering icon on the toolbar. You can also configure the numbering schemes by going to Project > Properties > Numbering.
 
To show the relationship between devices or wires across different pages or folders in your project, you can use cross-references that display the page number and location of the corresponding device or wire. You can create cross-references automatically or manually by going to Edit > Cross-references or by clicking on the cross-reference icon on the toolbar. You can also configure the cross-reference settings by going to Project > Properties > Cross-references.
