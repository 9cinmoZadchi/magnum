Peter Fox is best known as the lead singer of Seeed, a German reggae and dancehall band that has been making waves since the early 2000s. But in 2008, he decided to branch out and release his first solo album, Stadtaffe (Urban Ape), which became a huge success in Germany and beyond.
 
Stadtaffe is a unique blend of reggae, hip-hop, pop, and orchestral music, featuring catchy melodies, witty lyrics, and diverse influences. The album showcases Peter Fox's versatility as a vocalist and songwriter, as well as his ability to create a distinctive sound that reflects his Berlin roots.

The album opens with Alles Neu (Everything New), a powerful anthem that samples the theme from the film Amadeus and declares Peter Fox's intention to reinvent himself. The song is followed by Schwarz zu Blau (Black to Blue), a poetic ode to Berlin's nightlife and its contrasts. Haus am See (House by the Lake) is a laid-back tune that imagines a peaceful retirement away from the city's hustle and bustle.
 
Other highlights include Kopf Verloren (Lost Head), a humorous account of Peter Fox's struggles with paranoia and anxiety; Das Zweite Gesicht (The Second Face), a dark and mysterious song about hidden identities; Der Letzte Tag (The Last Day), a cheerful celebration of life in the face of death; and Fieber (Fever), a duet with K.I.Z., a German rap group known for their provocative and controversial lyrics.
 
Stadtaffe also features collaborations with other artists, such as Miss Platnum, Sido, and Cold Steel Drumline. The album was produced by The Krauts, a Berlin-based duo that has worked with Seeed and other German acts. The album also incorporates elements of classical music, thanks to the involvement of the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg, which adds a rich and dramatic layer to the songs.
 
Stadtaffe is a remarkable album that showcases Peter Fox's talent and creativity as a solo artist. It is an album that appeals to fans of different genres and cultures, as it mixes German and English lyrics, Jamaican and European rhythms, and urban and rural themes. It is an album that deserves to be heard by a wider audience, as it offers a fresh and original perspective on reggae music.
  
Stadtaffe received critical acclaim from various sources, such as AllMusic, Laut.de, and Musikexpress, which praised Peter Fox's lyrics, voice, and musical diversity. The album also won several awards, including the Echo Award for Best Hip Hop/Urban Artist in 2009 and the 1 Live Krone for Best Album in 2008. Stadtaffe was also voted as the 19th best German album of all time by Musikexpress in 2015.
 
The album spawned four singles, all of which charted in the top 20 of the German singles chart. The lead single, Alles Neu, was a massive hit that reached number four and stayed in the chart for 67 weeks. The song features a sample from Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 and was later covered by British rapper Plan B for his song Ill Manors. The second single, Haus am See, was another success that reached number three and stayed in the chart for 91 weeks. The song is a mellow reggae-pop tune that describes Peter Fox's dream of living in a house by the lake. The third single, Schwarz zu Blau, was the song that Peter Fox performed at the Bundesvision Song Contest 2009 and won with 44% of the votes. The song is a tribute to Berlin and its colorful atmosphere. The fourth and final single, Stadtaffe, was the title track of the album and reached number 18. The song is a funky and upbeat number that compares Peter Fox to an urban ape.
